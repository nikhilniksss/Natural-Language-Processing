# 🧠 ESG Sentiment Analyzer

A Streamlit-based application that performs sentiment analysis on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)-related financial news using a fine-tuned BERT model.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project addresses the need to detect **negative media coverage** and sentiment in ESG-related financial documents. Leveraging **BERT**, the model is fine-tuned on the **Financial PhraseBank** dataset for domain-specific accuracy.

Paste any ESG-related financial text into the app, and it will classify the sentiment as:

- ✅ Positive  
- ⚪ Neutral  
- ❌ Negative
